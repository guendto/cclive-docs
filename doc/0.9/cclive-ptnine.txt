NAME

cclive-ptnine - Overview of the changes in the cclive 0.9

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This document is not a comprehensive list of the changes since the 0.7
but a quick overview.

=== Shaking off the bloat

The goals of 0.9 are:

* Make better use of the Boost libraries
* Apply more of C++ eloquence
* Clean up the code base

Most of this means rewriting some of the code completely which is likely
to introduce new bugs that need to be ironed out for the 1.0 (next
stable).

=== Backwards-compatibility

0.9 aims to retain the backwards-compatibility with the 0.7 series.
That said, there are likely going to be minor changes (e.g. --quiet and
--verbose-libcurl -> --verbosity).

HIGHLIGHTS
----------

Improved option parsing::
  While Boost.Program_Options is a useful addition to the Boost
  libraries, it is also one of the least documented one. 0.9 aims to
  improve the use of PO.

Improved input parsing::
  RFC2483 is now supported. This makes it possible to use cclive 0.9+
  with quvi 0.9+. The input URIs are now also properly unescaped.

libquvi 0.9+ support::
  cclive compiles now with either libquvi 0.4 or 0.9+. When compiled
  with the latter, cclive will hint using `--stream' instead of the (now
  deprecated) `--prefer-format' option.

Removed features::
  All of those features marked as "deprecated" in the 0.7 have been
  removed in the 0.9 series.

Licensing changes::
  See <<li,LICENSE>> for more information.

WHERE
-----

See http://cclive.sourceforge.net/#get.  Further maintenance of the 0.7
series will take place in the 'maint-0.7' branch.

[[unst]]
UNSTABLE
--------

The 0.9 series is *unstable*. Expect bugs.  0.9 will gradually mature as
the next stable (1.0) replacing the current stable (0.7).

[[ifpkg]]
=== If you are a packager

Unless you are packaging bleeding-edge software for a bleeding-edge
distro, it is best to wait for the next stable (1.0).

[[inst]]
INSTALLATION
------------

cclive source tarball contains the *README* file which will cover the
basic instructions and provides any additional information (e.g.
regarding any non-standard options not covered by GNU Autotools).

NOTE: *Read the README first*, it is maintained by-hand and exists for a
      reason

If you cannot find the answers in the README, post your questions to the
<<rb,cclive-devel>> mailing list. It's possible that some of details may
still be missing from the README.  The INSTALL file is the standard file
provided by GNU Autotools.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

=== Generation

Typically:

----
$ make doc
----

For additional notes, see the README files.

=== Manual pages

The manpages (source files) are written in 'asciidoc(1)' syntax and can
be found under the doc/ subdir. They are accessible (after installation)
in the typical way:

----
$ man 1 cclive
