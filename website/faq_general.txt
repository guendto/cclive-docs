include::shared/license.txt[]

[[os]]
.Which operating systems does (lib)quvi run on?

GNU/Linux and BSD (supported by the upstream). Other ports may exist,
none of which the upstream officially supports.

[[clive]]
.How is cclive different from clive?

cclive (C++) is a rewrite of clive (Perl).

[[hostx]]
.Why cannot cclive support the x website?

cclive does not directly support any websites, the support is provided
by libquvi(-scripts) of the http://quvi.sourceforge.net/[quvi project].
See the quvi's FAQ
http://quvi.sourceforge.net/faq_general.html#whynotall[entry].

[[nonhttp]]
.Why does not cclive support x protocol?

The program was designed handle HTTP transfers only. Support for the
RTMP and other protocols are not currently implemented. Patches welcome.

== Filenames

[[tr]]
.How can I customize the title filter?

----
$ man 1 cclive
----

Look up the --tr option.

[[unicode]]
.Does cclive support unicode characters?

Yes.

[[noutf8]]
.Why am I seeing mangled characters in filenames?

This is most likely because your terminal/system hasn't been configured
to handle UTF-8. You would usually see something like this:

----
$ echo $LANG
en_US.UTF-8
----

On a GNU/Linux system you could get a list of all available public locales:
----
$ locale -a
----

Additionally, some terminals may not handle UTF-8 properly. With
'urxvt(1)', you might run:
----
$ LANG=en_US.UTF-8 urxvt &
$ cclive URL ;# run in the new terminal
----

== Other

[[stream]]
.How can I use (mediaplayer) to stream the media without downloading it?

Since cclive was intended to be a media download tool, you are better
off using 'quvi(1)' of the http://quvi.sourceforge.net/[quvi project]
and the '--exec' option.

[[subs]]
.Could cclive be used to download closed-captions/subtitles from YouTube?

Currently, no. But you could use either 'quvi-get(1)' (0.9+) of the
http://quvi.sourceforge.net/[quvi project], or
http://gcap.googlecode.com[gcap(1)]. The former is intended to replace
the latter, eventually.

[[plists]]
.Could cclive be used to download YouTube playlists?

Currently, no. But you could use either 'quvi-get(1)' (0.9+) of the
http://quvi.sourceforge.net/[quvi project], or
http://umph.googlecode.com[umph(1)]. The former is intended to replace
the latter, eventually.
